# How to start fresh

## cleaning the template

start with removing code files located in `source/mod` (that's where you'll write your code).

also make sure to remove `mod_base/sounds/piano.ogg`.

## importing existing code

If you want to use already wrttten code with this module, just drop the file (or entire contents of 'scripts' folder) into the `source/mod` directory.

While doing so remember to:
- change extemsion to `.hx`
- add `package` line to them (just like in normal haxe file)

## importing existing assets

Simply move them to `mod_base` folder.
