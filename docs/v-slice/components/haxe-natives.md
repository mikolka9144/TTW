## Haxe natives

Those classes are part of Flixel's code, but the devs have made them also available to be used as base classes in scripting.
These include:

- [FlxRuntimeShader](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons/blob/master/flixel/addons/display/FlxRuntimeShader.hx)
- [FlxSprite](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/FlxSprite.html)
- [FlxSpriteGroup](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/group/FlxSpriteGroup.html)
- [FlxState](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/FlxState.html)
- [FlxSubState](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/FlxSubState.html)
- [FlxUIState](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/addons/ui/FlxUIState.html)
- [FlxTransitionableState](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/addons/transition/FlxTransitionableState.html)

To use those just simply extend one of them.
