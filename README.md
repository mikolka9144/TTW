# TTW: coding on MAX
Let's bring the power of Haxe to the base game

# Getting started
Configure this environment with the help of [this guide](./docs/ttw/Compile%20guide.md)

IF case you stumble on any problems, please refer [here](./docs/ttw/issues.md) and [here](./docs/base_game/troubleshooting.md)

Create your code for a mod in a [mod](./source/mod/) directory (you can also create folders in it).

Other mod assets should be located in [mod_base](./mod_base/).

You can look around the included template files or remove them to start clean.

There are a few tasks for you to make use of:
- `Download assets` Download assets required for compilation (refer to guide).
- `Compile Mod` Exports your mod to a v-slice engine under a name defined in "Test.hx".
- `Launch Mod` Starts up your engine.
- `Compile&Launch mod` Does both of the tasks above.

Check out the [documentation](./docs/README.md) for more.
