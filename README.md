# TTW: coding on MAX
> Let's bring the power of Haxe to the base game

This template brings the possibilities and luxuries of writing source mods to the still-new and growing V-slice modding.

This project focuses on documenting the scripting format used by the game while also providing a much better environment for creating those.

# Features

> Code autocompletion

You can now bring code suggestions (with Ctrl + Space) as if you were writing a source mod. Those let you write your code faster and even take a peek into the Haxe's documentation or even documentation left in the game's code.

> Formatting

This template will automatically format your files to keep them more clean. You can edit `checkstyle.json` if you want to better customize it for your writing needs and your code style.

> Error checking

Just like in any normal language, you'll now be able to see any syntax errors in your code. This should hopefully make looking for errors much easier.

NOTE: You might encounter some false-positive errors in your code. Just because your code has errors doesn't automatically mean it won't work in FNF. They're more of a **suggestion**.

> Playtesting

Included under "Build and run" are tasks created to help you both test your mod and easily create a .zip file for you to share on the internet.

> FNFC Integration

You can now put .fnfc files directly into `fnfc_files` and they'll get automatically compiled with the rest of your mod.
